# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Reporter application needs to be packaged as distributable executables (DMG for macOS, EXE for Windows, and AppImage/deb for Linux) that users can download and run without needing to install Python or manage dependencies. The package should include both the CLI functionality for GitHub data collection and the PyQt dashboard interface for work tracking and standup report generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to download and run a single executable file for my operating system, so that I can use the Reporter app without installing Python or managing dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads the application package THEN the system SHALL provide platform-specific installers (DMG for macOS, EXE installer for Windows, AppImage/deb for Linux)
2. WHEN a user runs the installer THEN the system SHALL install the application with proper desktop integration (application menu, desktop shortcuts)
3. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies bundled within the package
4. WHEN a user launches the application THEN the system SHALL start the PyQt dashboard interface by default

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the packaged application to include both CLI and GUI functionality, so that I can use all features of the Reporter app from a single installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is installed THEN the system SHALL include both the PyQt dashboard GUI and CLI tools
2. WHEN a user runs the main executable THEN the system SHALL launch the PyQt dashboard interface
3. WHEN a user needs CLI functionality THEN the system SHALL provide command-line access to github_data.py functionality
4. WHEN the GUI is running THEN the system SHALL integrate with the CLI tools for GitHub data collection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain my work logs and GitHub data locally, so that my data persists between application sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs for the first time THEN the system SHALL create necessary data directories in the user's home folder
2. WHEN a user logs work entries THEN the system SHALL save them to persistent local files
3. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved work logs and GitHub data
4. WHEN a user updates GitHub data THEN the system SHALL store it in the local YAML file for future access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated build process that creates distribution packages for all platforms, so that I can easily release new versions of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed with a version tag THEN the system SHALL automatically build packages for macOS, Windows, and Linux
2. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL create properly signed and notarized packages where applicable
3. WHEN packages are built THEN the system SHALL upload them as GitHub release artifacts
4. WHEN building for macOS THEN the system SHALL create a DMG file with proper application bundle structure
5. WHEN building for Windows THEN the system SHALL create an installer EXE with proper Windows integration
6. WHEN building for Linux THEN the system SHALL create both AppImage and deb packages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have proper desktop integration, so that it feels like a native application on my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is installed on macOS THEN the system SHALL create a proper .app bundle in Applications folder
2. WHEN the application is installed on Windows THEN the system SHALL create Start Menu entries and desktop shortcuts
3. WHEN the application is installed on Linux THEN the system SHALL create desktop entries and integrate with the application menu
4. WHEN a user right-clicks the application icon THEN the system SHALL show appropriate context menu options for the platform
5. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL display proper application icons in the taskbar/dock

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to process my daily work logs through a local LLM to generate professional standup reports, so that I can quickly create formatted reports for team meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Generate LLM Report" THEN the system SHALL send the current day's work log to a local LLM API
2. WHEN the LLM processes the work log THEN the system SHALL display the generated standup report in a dedicated UI area
3. WHEN the LLM is not available THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with instructions to start the LLM
4. WHEN a user configures LLM settings in context.yml THEN the system SHALL use the custom prompt, model, and API endpoint
5. WHEN the generated report is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a "Copy LLM Report" button for easy sharing
6. WHEN work logs are too large THEN the system SHALL chunk the content appropriately for the LLM's context window
