# Reporter

A *LOCAL* simple work tracking app that helps you log daily activities and generate standup reports with GitHub integration.

Nothing goes to the internet unless you manually send it
You own the logs you create!


The goal is to apply the advice given in `Software Engineerâ€™s Guidebook/ Owning your career/ Keep a work log`
